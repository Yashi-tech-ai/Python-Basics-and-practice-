a = int(input("enter a number please "))
b = int(input("enter another number please "))
print("the number is : ", a)
print("the number is : ", b)
print("the sum is : ", a + b) # let a = 1 , b = 2 then a + b here shows 12 as the inputs taken are in strings so we will convert in 
#int(input("enter a number please "))
